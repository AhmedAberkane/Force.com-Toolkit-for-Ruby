SFROLODEX

This is a very simple Ruby on Rails application utilizing the asf-soap-adapter GEM for connectivity into a Salesforce org.  Once you have the GEM installed, you should be able to simply update the database.yml file with your username and password to get it up and running.  Hopefully this will help point developers in the right direction for updating the views and controllers for use with handling Salesforce data directly, without the need for a local database.
